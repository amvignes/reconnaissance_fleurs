Flower Recognition CNN
This project represents my first experience developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of tulips, roses, and sunflowers. Using a dataset from Kaggle, I built and optimized a CNN to perform this classification task.
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to leverage deep learning (specifically, CNNs) to classify flowers from images. Through this work, I explored core concepts of AI and learned how convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers can be used to build effective models.
This is my first attempt at creating a CNN, and the learning process involved experimenting with different model architectures and training strategies to optimize performance. The code is implemented in the projet.py file.
My Learning Journey
This project is a reflection of my growing interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, particularly in the application of supervised learning for image classification. While working on this CNN, I gained deeper insights into how models can be fine-tuned to achieve better accuracy and reliability.
Future Directions
I plan to expand my knowledge of AI to tackle more complex problems.
